**PROJECT AIRSAFE- Insights on Airliner, Corporate and Mil-Transport Aircraft Accidents (2019-24)** 

-----
**Overview**

Air travel is widely regarded as one of the safest modes of transportation. According to ICAO, in 2023, the global accident rate for **scheduled commercial flights** was **1.93 accidents per million departures**, a notable improvement from **2.25 per million departures** in 2019. These figures highlight ongoing advancements in aviation safety. However, there remain areas for improvement, particularly in addressing high-risk factors like **turbulence, runway excursions, and seasonal risks**. This project analyses global aviation accidents from 2019 to 2024 (for **Airliner, Corporate and Mil-Transport Aircrafts)** to provide actionable insights and granular recommendation for airlines, regulators, and passengers, ensuring further strides in air safety.

From the dataset, despite tragic accidents, aviation remains one of the safest modes of transportation. Over the six years, **1,360 accidents** were reported out of **over ~200 million flights**, with a fatality rate of **~1 in 94,000 flights**.

# Deep-Dive Analysis
1. **Trends Over Time: Are Fatalities Declining or Shifting?**

![](Aspose.Words.920fecba-c58a-4cb1-b3f7-57aa7a8ffd0e.004.png)![](Aspose.Words.920fecba-c58a-4cb1-b3f7-57aa7a8ffd0e.005.png)

- **Findings**:
  - From **2019 to 2024**, total accidents declined by **35.49%**, with accidents decreasing from **293 in 2019** to **189 in 2024**.
  - Despite the decline in overall accidents, **2020** and 2024 experienced a spike in fatalities, primarily due to catastrophic incidents like the **Tehran airliner shootdown**, resulting in **176 deaths** and tragic crash of a Boeing 737 (flight 226) of **Jeju airline** resulting in **179 deaths** in singular event respectively.
- **Context**:
  - The decline in number of accidents correlates with ICAO’s emphasis on implementing Safety Management Systems **(SMS)** and the widespread adoption of **Annex 19** guidelines.
  - However, **isolated high-fatality events** underscore the need for robust conflict zone management and real-time threat assessments.

- **Recommendations**:
  - **For Airlines**: 
    - Use ICAO’s **Conflict Zone Information Repository (CZIR)** to avoid high-risk airspaces.
    - Implement **enhanced pre-flight threat assessments** for routes near conflict zones.

- **For Regulators**: 
  - Mandate **geo-fencing technologies** for flights entering conflict-prone regions.

![](Aspose.Words.920fecba-c58a-4cb1-b3f7-57aa7a8ffd0e.006.png)

`  `**Observations from the Data**

1. **High Accident Rates in July and August**:
   1. These months consistently recorded the highest number of accidents across all aviation sectors (commercial, private, and military).
   1. ICAO safety reports from 2019 to 2023 corroborate this trend, citing **turbulence** and **thunderstorms** as leading contributors.





1. **Predominant Cause**:
   1. **Turbulence** was cited in **28.75% of accidents** during these months for scheduled commercial flights, disproportionately affecting flights over the **Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)** and regions prone to convective weather systems.

**Possible Explanations for the Trends**

- **Seasonal Weather Patterns**:
  - July and August coincide with peak summer months in many regions, increasing the prevalence of thunderstorms, turbulence, and strong vertical wind shears.
  - The **ITCZ’s seasonal shifts** heighten turbulence risks over the tropics.
- **Increased Air Traffic**:
  - Vacation travel leads to higher flight volumes, particularly in Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific, amplifying exposure to weather-related risks.
- **Operational Challenges**:
  - The summer travel rush increases workload for airlines, leading to potential pilot fatigue and diminished operational efficiency.

**Recommendations for Mitigation**

- **For Airlines**:
  - **Advanced Turbulence Detection**: 
    - Equip aircraft with predictive turbulence detection systems such as **Turbulence Aware** by IATA, which uses real-time data from multiple airlines to predict and avoid turbulent zones.
    - Train pilots to use **EDR (Eddy Dissipation Rate) metrics**, which provide a standardized measure of turbulence intensity.
  - **Enhanced Training**: 
    - Provide mandatory **turbulence recognition and management training** for pilots and cabin crew, with a focus on summer travel conditions.
    - Update simulators to include turbulence-specific scenarios.
  - **Fatigue Management**: 
    - Use **Fatigue Risk Management Systems (FRMS)** aligned with ICAO and EASA guidelines to optimize crew scheduling during peak summer months.


- **For Regulators**:
  - **Seasonal Safety Campaigns**: 
    - Conduct public safety awareness campaigns emphasizing turbulence risks and best practices for passengers (e.g., wearing seat belts during flights).
    - Launch global safety campaigns (aligned with **ICAO’s No Country Left Behind Initiative**) to educate airlines and passengers on turbulence preparedness.
  - **Real-Time Weather Monitoring**: 
    - Partner with meteorological organizations to enhance turbulence forecasting for summer months. For instance, ICAO’s **MET Panel** can improve coordination between airlines and weather agencies.
    - Mandate real-time meteorological updates through partnerships with weather agencies like WMO (World Meteorological Organization).
    - Integrate turbulence risk layers into ICAO’s Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System (GADSS).
- **For Passengers**:
  - **Flight Timing**: Schedule flights during early mornings or late evenings when turbulence is typically less intense.
  - **Safety Awareness**: Keep seat belts fastened at all times during the flight, regardless of turbulence warnings.
  - **Flight Routes:**
    Choose airlines with advanced turbulence monitoring systems (check ICAO safety ratings).

*Fig - Map showing only fatal accidents (Bubble size varies with number of deaths in that event)*

**Key Findings**

- **USA**: Accounted for **31.76%** of total accidents, with **Texas** recording the highest number of incidents. **Other high-incident airports**: **Nashville-John C. Tune Airport (KJWN)** and **Chicago-O'Hare International Airport (ORD)**, each with **12 accidents** due to frequent extreme weather (e.g., wind shear, tornadoes).
- **Runway Excursions**: Most incidents occur during landing, with poor runway conditions as a primary factor.
- **Conflict Zones**: Khartoum International Airport in Sudan recorded **21 accidents in 2023** due to ongoing armed conflict.

**Recommendations**

- **Conflict Zone Mitigation:**
- ICAO must enhance its Conflict Zone Information Repository, mandating airlines to use updated advisories.
- Increase diplomatic collaboration with regional bodies like AFI Plan (Africa-Indian Ocean Region) to secure high-risk zones.
- **Runway Condition Monitoring:**
- Equip high-risk airports with Runway Surface Friction Testers to ensure compliance with ICAO Annex 14 standards.
- Conduct quarterly audits of airport infrastructure in partnership with DGCA.
- **For Airlines**:
  - Prioritize **airport-specific safety drills**, particularly for high-risk airports.
  - Implement **Runway Safety Management Programs** that include advanced surface movement guidance systems (A-SMGCS).
- **For Regulators**:
  - Establish regional safety oversight teams to monitor high-risk airports dynamically.
  - Enforce stricter adherence to ICAO’s **Runway Safety Team (RST)** guidelines.
